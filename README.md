Xtóvu
=====

Xtóvu /ˈxtɔ.vu/ is an a priori, naturalistic, artistic, constructed language.
Its grammar is distinguished by being both topic-comment and having Austronesean alignment, where nearly any argument of the verb can take the direct case.
Further, its verbs take marking for deixis agreement, which is fused with the aspect suffix.
Its phonology is notable for several consonants with double articulation /ps, ks, gv, dv, gd, xt, sx/.
